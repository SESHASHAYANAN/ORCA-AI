# ORCA AI
Here's a pitch for Orca:

 I'm excited to present to you a groundbreaking web application called ORCA AI. ORCA AI is more than just an app—it's a movement, a platform designed to unite users from around the world in a shared mission to save our planet and world.

Abstract and the Need for ORCA AI
Let’s begin with the abstract and the underlying need for this application. In today’s world, despite the increasing awareness of environmental issues, there is still no comprehensive, sustainable platform where users can come together, track their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint and make sustainable choices effortlessly. This gap is what ORCA AI aims to fill.

ORCA AI is a sustainable social media app where users can track their emitted and saved CO2 and buy sustainable products directly from the app. It’s a platform that not only encourages but also facilitates a sustainable lifestyle by integrating personal environmental impact tracking with e-commerce and educational features.

Exploring the App
Now, let’s walk through the app.

Login Page
Starting with the login page, the entry point into the ORCA AI ecosystem. For the demo, the username is user1002 and the password is 123. It's important to note that only this specific combination allows access to the site, ensuring a controlled demo environment.

ORCA AI Dashboard
Once logged in, you are greeted by the ORCA AI dashboard. This is where the magic begins. The dashboard displays the total CO2 saved by you and collectively by all users, along with the number of trees planted. This provides an instant overview of your contribution to the environment and the impact of the entire community. It’s a simple yet powerful way to visualize your efforts in real-time.

Home Page
Next, we have the Home page, the heart of the user experience. Here, you can view your Sustainable Track—a comprehensive overview of your daily and weekly CO2 savings and the number of trees you’ve planted. This page serves as your personal sustainability diary, motivating you to stay on track with your environmental goals.

Calculate Page
Moving on, the Calculate page is where the true innovation of ORCA AI shines. This page utilizes the Gemini API to ask you simple yet essential questions to calculate how much CO2 you’ve saved throughout the day. The result is then seamlessly integrated into your Home page, ensuring that your efforts are always up-to-date.

Scoreboard
One of the key features of ORCA AI is the Scoreboard. This page adds a competitive edge to the platform, displaying a ranking of users based on their CO2 savings and trees planted. It’s designed to foster a healthy competition among users, motivating them to outdo each other in their sustainability efforts. The scoreboard not only boosts user engagement but also reinforces the app’s mission by turning sustainability into a rewarding experience.

Sustainable Products Marketplace
A critical feature of ORCA AI is its commitment to making sustainable living accessible. The app includes a Marketplace where users can purchase sustainable products at low prices. This not only encourages users to make eco-friendly choices but also makes sustainability affordable. You can easily click on a product to buy it or add it to your cart, and the product descriptions are generated using the Google Gemini API. For example, let’s take a look at a product—whether it’s eco-friendly clothing, reusable household items, or organic food products, the marketplace is designed to support your sustainable lifestyle.

Educational Hub
Education is a key pillar of ORCA AI. The Education feature offers users the opportunity to learn about the environment and sustainability in simple, digestible terms. The answers and content provided here are also powered by the Gemini API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. Whether you’re a sustainability novice or an expert, the educational hub caters to all levels of knowledge, making it easier for everyone to understand the importance of their actions.

Connect Feature
Building a community is at the core of ORCA AI, and that’s where the Connect feature comes in. This feature allows users to follow each other by viewing profiles, creating a network of like-minded individuals who are passionate about saving the environment. This social aspect of ORCA AI is crucial in fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose among users.

Search Feature
The Search feature is another innovative tool within ORCA AI. This feature allows users to search for plants based on images. Simply take a picture of a plant, and the app will provide you with detailed information about it. It’s a fun and educational way to learn more about the flora around you and how it contributes to the ecosystem.

Profile Page
Finally, we arrive at the Profile page. This is where users can view their personal information, including the number of people they are following and their followers. The profile page is a personal space where users can reflect on their journey and share their achievements with others.

Conclusion
ORCA AI is designed to ensure that sustainable living is not just a responsibility but also an enjoyable experience. By combining sustainability tracking, a marketplace for eco-friendly products, educational resources, and a vibrant social community, ORCA AI makes it easy and fun to save the environment.

In closing, I want to leave you with the core message of ORCA AI: "Save the environment, save yourself!" This app is not just about tracking CO2 or buying products; it’s about creating a global movement where every individual’s small actions add up to a significant impact.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to seeing how ORCA AI can help us all make a difference.
