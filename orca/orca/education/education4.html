                            **Carbon credits** are a market-based tool designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing economic incentives for companies and organizations to lower their carbon footprint. Each carbon credit represents the reduction or removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or an equivalent amount of another greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. These credits can be earned through various activities, such as investing in renewable energy projects, reforestation, or adopting energy-efficient technologies. Organizations that reduce their emissions below a certain threshold can sell their excess credits to other companies that are unable to meet their emissions reduction targets.
The concept of carbon credits is central to cap-and-trade systems, where governments set a limit (or cap) on the total amount of emissions allowed. Companies are given or must purchase a certain number of credits, and if they exceed their cap, they must buy additional credits from those who have reduced their emissions. This system creates a financial incentive for companies to invest in cleaner technologies and reduce their overall emissions, thus contributing to global efforts to combat climate change. By putting a price on carbon, carbon credits encourage businesses to innovate and find cost-effective ways to lower their environmental impact.
